## Introduction
Simple web application that you can use to browse places you should visit posted by other users, or even add your own places that you think are worth visitting. The project's main goal was to experiment with integrating different technologies such as Ionic React for front-end and Node.js for back-end. 

## General Information
The application is structured in two separate projects, one for front-end and one for back-end. Both of them have to be running, I will explain in the [Install](#install) section how to install and launch the application. 

The front-end application is responsive but was build with running mainly on mobile devices, some elements don't scale that well to desktop resolutions. Using the browser devtools I suggest trying different resolutions to see how the app adapts to them, but in my opinion it looks the best on the following devices: Iphone 8, Ipad, Anything with 1920 x 1080p resolution. These are the screens that I dedicated most of the time in order to make the app look good on them, for other screen sizes there might be some issues, but that wasn't the project's goal. Also the application features a dark/light theme and I strongly recoomend trying both, this can be done in Chrome by navigating to *Rendering* tab and setting *Emulate CSS media feature prefers-color-scheme* to any of the listed options.
